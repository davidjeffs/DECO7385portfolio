        <p>PASS - users were observed to complete tasks on the Twitter Tapper.

        <h1 class="telegramHeading">Discussion</h1>
        <div id="description">
        <P>Whilst the success criteria presented were not satisfactory to evaluate the success of the project, we can examine the feedback from an activity-centred point of view. The reason for this can be seen in the usability centred,and user-centric approach from the success criteria. A more encompassing approach is required, which is why the reflective report argues that an activity-centric approach allows for speculative designs to be analysed in this way.</P>
        <p>If we understand that there are contradictions between the various nodes of the activity centred approach we can examine whether these contradictions have been achieved in the concepts produced here.</p>
        <p>Based on the observations provided at the exhibition there was some contradictions occuring between the traditional activity model, and the futuristic one proposed by The Social Dial. This contradiction is largely based on the different rules effecting the interaction of users with the concept. However it may not be possible to state that these contradictions specifically caused a reflection on the idea that communication is easier with smart phones.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines of the contradiction we can certainly see that there was mismatch between the object and subject for younger generations who were unaware of the exact interaction with the rotary phone. Whilst these users did not usually use the phone for long, this may be a result of the frustration caused. A deep follow up interview would be required for this social grouping before any full assertions can be made.</p>
            
        <h1 class="telegramHeading">Following Up</h1>
        <p>Whilst some contradictions may have occured, and they may have caused reflection there are several areas of the design process and the concept that need to be addressed by future research.</p>
        <p>As discussed in the reflective report, the process undertaken was user centric which from the start effected the design direction. By taking an activity centred approach a more thorough speculative design can be achieved. However that does not mean users are not required. Users are one main node on the activity centred model.</p>
        <p>There is also a need to run the agile development process with a tighter consideration of deadlines. There were aspects of the design process which were held up by difficulties in the development process. Whilst other design activities were undertaken to fill the void, these activities were not as information producing as ones that were aimed for with a development process on time.</p>
        <p>However that is also a double edged sword. The beginning of the process was held up by limitations put on the design process.</p>
        
        <h1 class="telegramHeading">Future Directions</h1>
        <p>Whilst the concept produced was able to satisfactory explore the research space, there are still largely areas to explore. These include a deeper exploration of the context being designed for, which is the home environment.</p>
        <p>There is also scope to further explore detailed social media interactions rather than the main generalised ones used on the The Social Dial and Twitter Tapper.</p>
        <p>Further research can also be undertaken into graphically based social media networks.</p>
        <p>Finally, whilst this project was speculative in nature, there is room for practical application. Two main areas are providing accessibility to modern communication methods to older adults suffering from cognitive decline who would benefit from the familiarity provided by a rotary phone, but also the social engagement. Second there is possibility to assist the vision impaired in accessing graphic oriented social media networks through the use of image recognition algorithms.</p>

        <h1 class="telegramHeading">Reflection</h1>
        <div id="description">
        <p>This stage of the project allowed us to implement some design decisions and test some of the assumptions that we had made during them. Due to our telephone concept being constrained by the form factor, most decisions that were made, were within the underlying code.</p>
        <p>As such this part of the design process focused largely on the workflow and the users experience with this workflow. As based on the original user research, many users already have a mental model of how the Social Media networks flow. The flow was intended to match this with the difficult interactions provoking at reflection of the ease of interaction through smart phones.</p>
        <p>As mentioned in the reflective report it is this type of interaction which best designed and then analysed using an activity centred approach. An activity centred approach realises the different facets encompassing the interaction such as the form factor, social media workflow, and interaction methods. As described by activity theory, the user is undergoing a conversation with the object.</p>

        <p>This exploration stage placed the concept well in terms of background research. The research was linked in with contextual inquiry which showed that there is generational differences between technologies, such as [1]. The academic research that I undertook identified slow technology [2] as a possible method to provoke reflection. I was also able to identify a number of sci-fi references, and link these to academic theory such as the role of gestural communication. In retrospect this theory was a good grounding to justify the concept from a problem point of view, however not from an explorative point of view. </p>
        <p>To justify the explorative aspect of the project further, more research should be put into exploring how other academic projects have explored the idea of generational differences in communication.</p>

        <div id="description">
        <p>By this stage of the project the team had a solid idea of concept to be produced, however with little academic research there was lot of user research to be undertaken.</p>
        <p>The user research was undertaken by myself for the majority of activities with help from Julien and Yaxin. </p>
        <p>In reflection of this aspect of the project, it is thought that the research activities themselves were exploratory in nature. Whilst it is good to explore new forms of information gathering, thought needs to be placed into whether they are suitable for the task at hand. As identified in the academic reflection paper there is required to be thought put into all aspects of the design process, including the process itself. A user-centric method is suitable to the design for problems that users encounter, however not as useful for designing speulative concepts. </p>
        <p>However from a user centric point of view, I was able to use this data to begin the creation of personas. These personas identfied that there was a difference between the generations.However it was clear from this research that not all the bases were being covered, and that situated knowledge was beginning to show glimpses.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>For the text-to-speech initially the popular Pyttsx for python was used. THe framework was developed around this, however with the introduction of threading it was discovered that threading and pyttsx are incompatible on Mac. Thus a switch was made to Google text-to-speech which was slower.</li>
        <li>Threading was programmed in to allow for multiple functions to run simultaneously. These functions include dialing, playing speech, and access the Facebook API developed by Will.</li>
        <li>Python was used simply due to its simplistic nature and ease of connection to the variety of frameworks that we were accessing.</li>
        <li>To allow for users to spell their name a change was made to the speech address values. Alphabet letters were added to prevent users from spelling out words.</li>
        <li>To allow users to state the word 'space' for the gap between their name, .replace() was used</li>
